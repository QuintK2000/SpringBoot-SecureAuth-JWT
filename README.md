# Spring Boot 3.0 Security with JWT Implementation

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates a robust authentication and authorization system using **Spring Boot 3.0** and **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. It ensures secure access to resources by implementing role-based authorization and encrypted password management.

## ✨ Features
- **User Authentication & Registration** - Secure signup and login with JWT-based authentication.
- **Password Encryption** - Utilizes **BCrypt** for secure password hashing.
- **Role-Based Authorization** - Access control enforced using **Spring Security**.
- **JWT Handling** - Secure generation, validation, and refreshing of JWT tokens.
- **Custom Access Denied Handling** - Provides a user-friendly response for unauthorized access attempts.
- **Logout Mechanism** - Securely invalidates JWT upon logout.
- **Refresh Token Implementation** - Extends session validity without requiring re-login.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot 3.0** - Java-based framework for building robust applications.
- **Spring Security** - Implements authentication and access control.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** - Provides secure authentication mechanism.
- **BCrypt** - Ensures secure password storage.
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database for managing user credentials.
- **Maven** - Dependency and build management.

## 📌 Project Scope
This project serves as a **secure authentication template** for web applications requiring:
- Secure user registration and authentication.
- Token-based authentication and session management.
- Fine-grained access control with role-based permissions.
- Secure handling of user credentials and session invalidation.

## 🏗️ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **JDK 17+**
- **Maven 3+**
- **PostgreSQL** with a database named `jwt_security`

## 📜 API Endpoints
### 🔑 Authentication & User Management
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/auth/register` | POST | Register a new user |
| `/auth/login` | POST | Authenticate user and generate JWT |
| `/auth/refresh` | POST | Refresh access token |
| `/auth/logout` | POST | Logout and invalidate JWT |

### 🔒 Protected Routes (Role-Based Authorization)
| Endpoint | Method | Access |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/admin/dashboard` | GET | Admin only |
